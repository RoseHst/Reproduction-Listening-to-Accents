The reviewed work has been precisely reproduced in its entirety on a Windows machine (Windows 11 Pro, Version 24H2, Build 26100.4652) following steps below:

-   Install WSL along with the designated Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
-   Install Git
-   Install Nix within WSL
-   Enable Nix Flakes
-   Fetch data via git-annex
-   Rebuild the original paper
-   Install wslu
-   Locate rebuilt file
-   Verify rebuilt file

The reproduction procedure was smooth, as sufficient instruction for each step can be found in the posted README file. In addition, the authors provide code for automatically verifying the reproduction against the original paper, which enables immediate comparison and the output of which is accordance with the expectation.

The reviewed work is high in executability, as compatibility with the most widespread operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows) was taken into consideration by the authors when providing instruction for reproduction.

The reviewed work is high in readability, as both the documentation (.md) and the paper itself (.pdf) are accessible in formats generally supported across platforms. 

Data used to produce the analysis are accessed through an established version control system (git-annex), which benefits findability, durability and authenticity thereof.

The reviewed work is licenced under CC0 1.0 Universal, which allows others to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the work for any purpose. thereby ensuring complete openness, accessibility and reusability of methods as well as results involved.

Understandability of the reviewed work varies depending on how familiar readers are with the functionality of certain software, in this case Nix the package manager in particular. When rebuilt with a single line of command, there is no apparent 1-to-1 correspondence between code and code-generated analytic outcome (statistics and visualization thereof) in the paper, which is to be found in a separated python script not specifically mentioned in documentation. In certain disciplines, formats enabling seamless integration of code and analytic outcome (e.g. knitr, Juypter) are more prevalent, which are not necessarily a better, but definitely a viable option.
