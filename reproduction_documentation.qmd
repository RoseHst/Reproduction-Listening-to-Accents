# Notes

R-Markdown script provided but takes forever to render (like more than 1 hour) and heats up the system (because it fits several highly complex models)

- first goal: work with .csv files to recreate descriptive results
    - properties of speech samples used for the tasks → tables
    - comprehensibility ratings; accentedness ratings → violin plots
    - self-reported familiarity → tables
    - transcription accuracy (number & proportion of correctly transcribed content and function words of each speaker of English); which types of transcription errors occurred most frequently
    - self-reported ease of understanding speakers with different accents - match with their actual understanding? (linear correlation?) → scatterplots
